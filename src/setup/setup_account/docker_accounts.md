## Step 2: Docker Account Setup

(dt-account-dockerhub)=
### DockerHub

Duckietown uses [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/duckietown) to distribute the containerized version 
of its software modules.

If you do not have one already,
you can sign up for a DockerHub account at [this link](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

You will need to note your username and password to use in the following setup steps.

### Configure Docker login

We leverage containerization a lot for reproducibility. Most procedures entail some `docker` operations behind the scene. That is why we need to begin by setting up the logins for docker within `dts`.

```{attention}
* The credentials are only stored locally.
* They are stored in **plain text** at `~/.dt-shell/config.yaml`.
* You can use an access token instead of your account password! (to obtain one: [see this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/))
```  

You can pass your DockerHub credentials to the Duckietown Shell by running the following command,
```bash
dts config docker set \
    --username YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME \
    --password YOUR_DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

```{admonition} For developers

With an extra **positional** argument, one could specify a custom docker registry server other than 
`docker.io`. Check `dts config docker set --help` for more details.
```

Use the following to verify your input,
```bash
dts config docker info
```


## Verify everything is correct

Before we move on, let us make sure you have installed everything correctly.

If some of these commands donâ€™t work, please go back and fix it before continuing.

If the Docker installation went well, then you can run the following command:

    $ docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

If you set up a Github account and private key, you should be able to run this command successfully:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

If you have a valid DockerHub account then you can login as follows.

    $ docker login -u DOCKER_USERNAME

## FAQs

```{trouble}
I mistakenly set a wrong/unwanted username or password. How can I update the credentials?
---
Just run the command again with the correct credentials. 
Only the latest inputs are stored for the same docker registry.
```

```{trouble}
I would like to remove my stored docker credentials. How could I achieve that?
---
Simply use a text editor to remove the section `docker-credentials` in `~/.dt-shell/config.yaml` file.
```
