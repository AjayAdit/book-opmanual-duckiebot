## Step 0: GitHub Account Setup

Duckietown uses [GitHub](https://github.com/duckietown) to distribute its open-source code and engage with
collaborators and end-users.  If you are unfamiliar with Git, we strongly recommend reading the following reference page to gain a 
working understanding of this tool: [The Duckietown Intro to Git](version_control_with_git).

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can sign up for one at [this link](https://github.com/join).

Once you have a GitHub username, you can continue on to the next page to set up your Duckietown account.
