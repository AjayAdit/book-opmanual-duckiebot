## Step 0: GitHub Account Setup

Duckietown uses [GitHub](https://github.com/duckietown) to distribute its open-source code and engage with
collaborators and end-users.

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can sign up for one at [this link](https://github.com/join).

Once you have a GitHub username, you can continue on to the next page to set up your Duckietown account.
