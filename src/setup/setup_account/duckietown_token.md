# Retrieve your Duckietown token

The Duckietown Token allows you to authenticate yourself and your robots against the Duckietown network.

The token is a string of letters and numbers that looks something like this:

    dt1-7vEuJsaxeXXXXX-43dzqWFnWd8KBa1yev1g3UKnzVxZkkTbfSJnxzuJjWaANeMf4y6XSXBWTpJ7vWXXXX

To find your token, first [log in](https://www.duckietown.org/pm_login) to your account, 
then open [this page](https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token) in your browser:

```{note}
It may take up to 5 minutes after signing up for a token to be generated.
```

## Verify everything is correct

Before we move on, let us make sure you have installed everything correctly.

If some of these commands donâ€™t work, please go back and fix it before continuing.

If the Docker installation went well, then you can run the following command:

    $ docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

If you set up a Github account and private key, you should be able to run this command successfully:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

If you have a valid DockerHub account then you can login as follows.

    $ docker login -u DOCKER_USERNAME
    Password:

If the Duckietown Shell was installed, then you can run a command like this,

    dts version

If you correctly configured the token, then the command below should show something similar to the following,

    $ dts challenges info
