# Installing `dts`

In this section, an application called `dts`, or the ***Duckietown Shell*** is set up.

It is a [command-line interface (CLI) prgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) which is used often with Duckietown operations, such as
* Updating a Duckiebot
* Driving a Duckiebot with a virtual keyboard
* Viewing the camera stream of a Duckiebot from a graphical app
* Using our MOOC exercise
* (and more!)
